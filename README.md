An isometric tile-based game. Currently just generates maps and allows your 18th century avitar to explore them.

Inspired by the 1990's survival game Unreal World.

* Written in C++ with OpenGL version 3.3
* Uses perlin-Noise to procedurally generate terrain with elevation out of 2d, isometric tiles.
* Features *VERY* homemade textures

Was built shortly after following  Joey de Vries fantastic tutorial series at https://learnopengl.com. Peices of his 
code can be found scattered throughout the project, especially in functions relating to loading textures, compiling 
shaders and text-rendering.
