# frontier

A procedurally-generated, isometric, tile-based world.

Inspired by the 1990's survival game Unreal World (although not nearly as complete).

This was built shortly after following  Joey de Vries fantastic tutorial series at https://learnopengl.com. Peices of his 
code can be found scattered throughout the project, especially in functions relating to loading textures, compiling 
shaders and text-rendering.
